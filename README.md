# Unblocked Games

***(THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN BETA, NO GAMES ARE ADDED YET)***

**Made by Huaze**

**Version: *Beta 1.6***

## How to use

Use [OneCompiler](https://onecompiler.com/) to run this code. Click on **HTML**, at the top delete **styles.css** and **script.js**. Replace the entire code (in OneCompiler) to this *Unblocked Games* code. *You can use Visual Studio Code to run too.*

### ⚠️If you are using OneCompiler⚠️

The export button does not work in OneCompiler. Clicking it will fallback and open a new tab with the JSON code (basically the export code). To make an export file, open the app ***Text*** and paste the JSON code from the fallback. Save the file with an extension '.json' (e.g. ***export.json***).
