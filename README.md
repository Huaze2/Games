# Unblocked Games

***(THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN BETA, NO GAMES ARE ADDED YET)***

**Made by Huaze**

**Version: *Beta 1.6***

## How to use

Click the link: **https://onecompiler.com/html/443ufq5qf**

### ⚠️If you are using OneCompiler⚠️

The export button does not work in OneCompiler. Clicking it will fallback and open a new tab with the JSON code (basically the export code). To make an export file, open the app ***Text*** and paste the JSON code from the fallback. Save the file with an extension '.json' (e.g. ***export.json***).
