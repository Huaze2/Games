### ⚠️If you are using the link⚠️

The export button does not work in OneCompiler. Clicking it will fallback and open a new tab with the JSON code (basically the export code). To make an export file, open the app ***Text*** and paste the JSON code from the fallback. Save the file with an extension '.json' (e.g. ***export.json***). (***THIS GUIDE IS FOR PLDs***)
